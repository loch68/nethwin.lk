## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Charts not showing?
1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Verify Chart.js loaded**: Look for Chart.js in Network tab
3. **Check data APIs**: Ensure `/api/orders` and `/api/admin/print-orders` work
4. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Reports still failing?
1. **Check server console** for error messages
2. **Look for warnings**: "⚠️ No charts generated" is OK - report still downloads
3. **Verify Canvas**: Server should show "✅ Generated X charts"
4. **Fallback active**: Reports work even without charts

### Server won't start?
```powershell
# Kill any existing Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start fresh
cd backend
npm start
```
